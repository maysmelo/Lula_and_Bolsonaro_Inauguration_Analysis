# Lula and Bolsonaro Inauguration Analysis
This is my first Python project, which has the objective of using Whisper AI to transcribe the inauguration speech of Lula and Bolsonaro so I can run some analysis based on the speech.

# Context:
Lula's third term started in January 1st 2023, his speech was very emotional, talking about all the challenges Brazil has faced in the last 4 years and his objectives for this new term. I wanted to run a quick analysis on the last president's inauguration speech and the current and check what kind of insights will come out of it. 

#Idea:
Get the top 15 most used words of each speech and explore the data.

# Personal Objectives:
I don't have one big objective with this, but several:
- Build a good first project;
- Expand my knowledge in graphs in Python;
